### What Is Game Development?

Game development is the development of a game, hence **game development**. For easier understanding, let's call a person who creates a game a "Game Dev". There are multiple tools that a game dev has at their disposal. Some game devs use different game making software that include Unity, Construct, Godot, Unreal Engine, and many more. Most of these software depends on the user's taste, but they all end up with the same outcome. Lets get more in depth about game development

### Necessary Skills

There are some necessary skills that are needed to first become a game dev. To begin with, you need to

- Have a understanding of Computer Science
- Understand how to write, read, and create code
- Have at least played or tried playing games, (To understand the users standpoint)
- Creativity
- Passion and commitment

These are just a few skills that you need to first become a game dev or create a game. Having a good sense of all of these skills will help you better in the long run.

Going more in depth, game development involves code. So having an understanding of computer science is a must.  You need to understand copyright laws so you don't get in trouble, the basics of coding, and how the internet basically works. Code is used all over the internet. So this is a must when creating a game. How could you create a game without using code in the first place? Another thing that you have to take into account would be how games function in the first place. If you don't know how games are made or played, then how are you going to create a game in the first place? And some other things you have to take into account is creativity, passion, and commitment. All three of these things help you create the game in the first place, having enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment when completing it.

### Available Competitions
