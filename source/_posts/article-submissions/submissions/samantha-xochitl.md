Brief Description: Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization in which students can enhance their knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Vladovic Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy has offered TSA for more than a year and has allowed students to participate in competitions and gain knowledge for prospect careers.

### What does Cybersecurity _involve_?

Though Cybersecurity is not officially in [TSA](https://tsaweb.org/) 2022 - 2023 page, Cybersecurity deals with protecting computer systems including hardware, software, data storage, and network. There are events such as **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions that are critical in educating students on important concepts in the attack and defense of systems.

### Skills

- Problem Solving
  - This will play a **major role** in day-to-day tasks, as it does in any high demanding subject
  - When it comes to solving practice challenges, you will have to figure out how to do it by **referring to the resources** that can help you
- Communication and Collaboration
  - While working closely with teammates and other colleagues, it is important to be able to **effectively explain** findings, concerns, and solutions
- Understanding
  - It must be known that Cybersecurity **is not limited to computers**.
  - The individual should feel comfortable working on a variety of operating systems (O.S.), computer systems, mobile devices, cloud networks, and wireless networks
- Risk Management
  - It is the ability to think through what could possibly go wrong and **assess the severity of threat**. It is a skill that develops through time and allows you to reduce the amount of time spent on debugging.
- Scripting
  - It is a type of coding in which you **make a program do something**. For example, it can make images and text move around!

We must not forget that you have to be determined! It’s not easy but you have many resources
that you can get help from :)

### Competitions

If you contact the leader of TSA, you can go more in depth on what competitions you can do

#### picoCTF

PicoCTF mainly serves as a **free security game** targeting middle and high schoolers. This game is centered around a series of challenges of reverse engineering, hack, decrypt, and many other things in order to solve the challenge. This is a great competition for beginners to enhance their skill and gain knowledge in coding.

#### CyberStart America
