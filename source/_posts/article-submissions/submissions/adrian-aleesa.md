### What does competitive programming involve?

Competitive programming is an exercise to put your skills and understanding to the test in data structures, programming, and algorithms.

### What does a competitive programmer do?

A competitive programmer, during a competition, will be tasked to write lines of code from programs to solve errors or just general computer problems.
	  

### What competitions are offered, and how are these competitions structured?

Competitive Programmers must learn their preferred programming language (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.). Data structures and Algorithms also play a key role in programming. Without knowing these concepts well, it will be hard to come up with an efficient way to solve a programming problem. They then need to understand what they are doing competitively so they wonâ€™t fall to stress or get used to no time limit.

Programming competitions offered include CodeChef, HackerRank, LeetCode, Codeforces, Project Euler, American Computer Science League and Facebook Hacker Cup and many more. These competitions are usually composed of teams with a certain objective working against the clock to outspeed and outperform the other.
