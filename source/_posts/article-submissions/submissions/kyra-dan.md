### What are in game development competitions?

Game development competitions involve programming, game design, and story. For TSA, game development competitions involve the making of the game, a documentation portfolio, and an interview*.

In the game design section, competitors need to have four different criteria. The first criterion is creativeness and artisanship of the game. Judges will look for a smooth-flowing storyline. Technical skills are another piece of criteria because all games must function in order to be judged. The overall aesthetic will also be judged in this section.

In the documentation portfolio, participants must have all portfolio elements, game directions, plan of work log, and storyboard. The portfolio should be organized well to meet full marks. Clear and concise game directions and an accurate work log are also judged upon.

<sub>*Interview is only applicable to semi-finalists.</sub>

### What skills are needed in a competition?

The skills needed in competitions are creativeness, ingenuity, teamwork, communication, coding proficiency, and time management. 

For most competitions, there is a theme that competitors have to follow. This is where the competitors' creativity and ingenuity comes in. The competitors would need to make a game that can catch the judges eyes.

Teamwork, communication, and time management is essential for finishing the game itself. Most game development competitions require a team to be able to participate in the competition. Since the competitions have deadlines, having good communication means that managing time and splitting up the work can make the game development process easier.

### **Competition Structure**

The structure of the competition varies for each event. The rules may also be different from each other in terms of judging. Some competitions have multiple sub-categories that focus on game genre, art and animation, audio design, or pure programmingâ¸ºothers might not. However, most competitions do follow a single-elimination, tournament-style format.

One can compete individually, though most competitions are based on teams. These teams may also be split by grade, especially if the competition is open to students. 

Most judges will assess how fun the game is, but will also check if it meets the standard requirements. These requirements differ, but usually consist of:

* Is the game interesting?
* Is the game well-balanced?
* Does the game run smoothly with no bugs?
* Does the game follow the theme?
* and much more!
