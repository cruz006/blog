### What does the Game Design competition involve?

The Game Design competition has people working on two things; the Design of the Game and the Portfolio Document.

#### Game section

The game design section is worth 70 points, with the categories it will be judged on being **Creativity** and **Artisanship**, **Technical Skill**, **Storyline/Flow of the Game**, and the **Overall Appeal** of the game. Some sections of the categories will be worth different points, as you can see the Story/Flow of the Game is only worth 10 Points max, while each other category is worth up to  **20 points**. Look below for how each section is judged accordingly.

This means your team will have to plan out your game, the mechanics, the design of the game, the enjoyment factor while playing the game, and the story.

#### Documentation Portfolio

The documentation portfolio section is not worth as many points as the game, but it is still 40 points. Unlike the Game Design section, each category is worth the same amount of points, 10 points maximum. This section is judged by the **portfolio components**, **game directions and control**, **plan of work log**, and the **storyboarding** of the game. Look below for how each section is judged accordingly.

### What skills are needed in this competition?

In creating the game, you need to be creative when designing the different mechanics that will be in the game, you will need to work well in a team, organize the different steps you will take in order to finish the tasks at hand, and you will need to be proficient in your coding to develop a game. Being familiar with game design will definitely help with this competition, as learning it for the first time is a big learning curve that will take time, and the first time you design a game it may have quite a bit of issues.
